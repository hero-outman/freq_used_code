# Computing ENCODE-defined naive overlapping narrowPeak set from two ATAC or ChIP individual replicate narrowPeak and replicate-pooled narrowPeak sets
# Definition from Kundaje et al.: "Find pooled peaks that overlap Rep1 and Rep2 where overlap is defined as the fractional overlap wrt any one of the overlapping peak pairs >= 0.5".
# usage: naiveOverlapNarrow treat1_peaks.narrowPeak treat2_peaks.narrowPeak treat_pool_peaks.narrowPeak > treat_overlap_peaks.narrowPeak
# ensure to firstly make executable by: chmod u+x naiveOverlapNarrow

# dependencies: bedtools (for intersectBed / bedtools intersect)

# intersectBed -wo will combine two peak in one line and with overlaped bp number.
# $21 is overlap bp number.
# s1=$3-$2; s2=$13-$12 are the length of two peaks intersected by bedtools
